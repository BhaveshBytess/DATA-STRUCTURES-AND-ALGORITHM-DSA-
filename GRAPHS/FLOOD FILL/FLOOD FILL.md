Letâ€™s tackle **LeetCode 733. Flood Fill** :


---
## Flood Fill (LeetCode 733)

### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `image`, representing the pixel values of an image, and three integers `sr`, `sc`, and `newColor`.

Perform a **"flood fill"** on the image starting from the pixel `image[sr][sc]`.

- A flood fill changes the starting pixel's color and **all connected pixels** (via direct 4-directional adjacency) that have the **same original color** to `newColor`.
    
- You may assume all values are integers in the range [0, 65535].
    

Return the final image after performing the flood fill.

---

### Example 1:

```
Input:
image = [[1,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,1]]
sr = 0, sc = 0, newColor = 2

Output:
[[2,2,0,0],[2,2,0,0],[0,0,1,1]]
```

Here, you flood fill starting at `(0,0)`â€”color `1`â€”so all connected `1`s change to `2`.

---

### Example 2:

```
Input:
image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
sr = 0, sc = 0, newColor = 0

Output:
[[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
```

Since `newColor` is the same as the original, nothing changes.

---

### Objective

Write the function:

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> floodFill(
    vector<vector<int>>& image,
    int sr,
    int sc,
    int newColor
);
```

Implement this using your DFS or BFS skills â€” **no hints or full solution until youâ€™ve thought it through**.

---

## Key Points to Think:

- How will you **avoid infinite loops** when changing colors in cycles?
    
- When should you **return early**, e.g. if the `newColor` is the same as the original color?
    
- How will you navigate the **4-directional neighbors** in the grid?
    

---

### Your Turn:

Work through your strategy:

- If going DFS â†’ how will you mark visited or ensure you donâ€™t revisit?
    
- If BFS â†’ how will you queue neighbors?
    
- How will you change the color **only for connected pixels of the same original color**?

# MINI-NOTE

Hereâ€™s your **Mini Note** for **Flood Fill (Leetcode 733)** â€” a foundational grid graph problem:

---

**MINI NOTE**

ðŸ”¹ **Problem**: Flood Fill (Leetcode 733)  
ðŸ”¹ **Graph Type**: Grid Graph (2D Matrix)  
ðŸ”¹ **Technique**: DFS or BFS  
ðŸ”¹ **Core Template**: Standard 4-directional DFS/BFS on grid  
ðŸ”¹ **Pattern Tag**: #MatrixGraph #DFS #BFS #ImageFill

---

ðŸ”¸ **Logic Summary**:

- Starting from a given cell, **recolor** all connected cells with the same **initial color** into a **new color**.
    
- Recursively/Iteratively move in **4 directions** (up, down, left, right).
    
- Only continue if the neighboring cell has the **same original color** and hasn't been visited or changed yet.
    

---

ðŸ”¸ **Trick**:

- Handle the **early return** if `newColor == originalColor` â†’ avoids infinite recursion.
    
- Track bounds (`i >= 0 && i < n && j >= 0 && j < m`) to avoid overflow.
    

---

ðŸ”¸ **Why BFS & DFS both work**:

- Both visit all reachable same-colored pixels.
    
- DFS is often **shorter in code**, BFS may be **safer against stack overflow** for large images.
    

---

ðŸ”¸ **Why Other Approaches Donâ€™t Work**:

- You canâ€™t brute-force recolor everything â€” it must be **connected and same color**.
    
- Using a visited array is **optional**, because you can mutate the grid directly.
    

---

ðŸ”¸ **Final Insight**:  
This is the **foundation** of matrix-based graph traversal â€” sets the base for 01 Matrix, Rotten Oranges, Walls & Gates, etc.

Hereâ€™s your **clean, submission-ready Flood Fill DFS solution** in C++ (LeetCode style):

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(int row, int col, vector<vector<int>>& image, int originalColor, int newColor) {
        int m = image.size(), n = image[0].size();

        // Boundary + visited + color check
        if (row < 0 || row >= m || col < 0 || col >= n || image[row][col] != originalColor)
            return;

        image[row][col] = newColor;

        // 4-directional movement
        dfs(row + 1, col, image, originalColor, newColor);
        dfs(row - 1, col, image, originalColor, newColor);
        dfs(row, col + 1, image, originalColor, newColor);
        dfs(row, col - 1, image, originalColor, newColor);
    }

    vector<vector<int>> floodFill(vector<vector<int>>& image, int sr, int sc, int newColor) {
        int originalColor = image[sr][sc];
        if (originalColor != newColor) {
            dfs(sr, sc, image, originalColor, newColor);
        }
        return image;
    }
};
```

---

### Time & Space Complexity:

- **Time:** O(m Ã— n) â€” in the worst case, we may visit every pixel.
    
- **Space:** O(m Ã— n) recursion stack in worst case (if all pixels are same color).
    


---

Let's now do the **BFS version of Flood Fill**. Same logic as DFS, just implemented **iteratively** using a **queue** instead of recursion.

---

## **Flood Fill â€” BFS Version**

Leetcode-style C++ code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> floodFill(vector<vector<int>>& image, int sr, int sc, int newColor) {
        int oldColor = image[sr][sc];
        if (oldColor == newColor) return image;  // No change needed

        int rows = image.size();
        int cols = image[0].size();

        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        q.push({sr, sc});
        image[sr][sc] = newColor;

        // Directions: up, down, left, right
        int dx[] = {-1, 1, 0, 0};
        int dy[] = {0, 0, -1, 1};

        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [x, y] = q.front();
            q.pop();

            for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
                int nx = x + dx[i];
                int ny = y + dy[i];

                // Check bounds and color match
                if (nx >= 0 && nx < rows && ny >= 0 && ny < cols && image[nx][ny] == oldColor) {
                    image[nx][ny] = newColor;
                    q.push({nx, ny});
                }
            }
        }

        return image;
    }
};
```

---

## Key Points:

- **Base condition**: If the color you're trying to flood with is the same as the starting pixel â†’ return immediately.
    
- BFS spreads level by level â€” hence, we use a queue (`std::queue`) to keep track of which pixels to color next.
    
- We mark the cell as colored _as soon as we push it to the queue_ â€” so we donâ€™t process it again.

## LeetCode Style Problem: **Word Ladder**

### Problem Statement

A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a **dictionary** `wordList` is a sequence of words such that:

1. The first word is `beginWord`.
    
2. The last word is `endWord`.
    
3. Each word in the sequence **differs by only one character** from the previous word.
    
4. Every word in the sequence (except `beginWord`) is in the given `wordList`.
    

**Note:**

- Return the **length of the shortest transformation sequence** from `beginWord` to `endWord`.
    
- If no such sequence exists, return `0`.
    

---

### Constraints

- Only one letter can be changed at a time.
    
- Each transformed word must exist in the `wordList`.
    
- Words are all of the same length.
    
- All words consist of lowercase English letters.
    
- `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` are no longer than `10^4` characters in total.
    

---

### Example 1:

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: One shortest transformation is:
"hit" → "hot" → "dot" → "dog" → "cog", which is 5 steps.
```

---

### Example 2:

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: 0

Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, so no valid transformation.
```

---

### Function Signature (C++)

```cpp
int ladderLength(string beginWord, string endWord, vector<string>& wordList);
```

# MINI-NOTE : 

🔹 **Problem:** Word Ladder I  
🔹 **Graph Type:** Implicit Word Graph (Each word is a node, edges exist if words differ by 1 letter)  
🔹 **Technique:** BFS (Unweighted Shortest Path)  
🔹 **Core Template:**

```cpp
queue<string> q;
unordered_set<string> wordSet; // for O(1) lookup
q.push(beginWord);

while (!q.empty()) {
    for (int i = 0; i < q.size(); ++i) {
        string word = q.front(); q.pop();
        if (word == endWord) return level;
        for (each position) {
            for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; ++c) {
                string newWord = word;
                newWord[pos] = c;
                if (wordSet.count(newWord)) {
                    q.push(newWord);
                    wordSet.erase(newWord); // mark visited
                }
            }
        }
    }
    level++;
}
return 0;
```

🔹 **Pattern Tag:** #BFS #ShortestPath #WordGraph #UnweightedGraph

---

🔸 **Logic Summary:**

- Transform `beginWord` into `endWord` by changing one letter at a time.
    
- Each transformed word must be in `wordList`.
    
- Goal is to find the shortest transformation **length**, not the path.
    
- Classic **BFS** problem in disguise → shortest path in unweighted graph.
    

---

🔸 **Trick:**

- Don't pre-build the graph.
    
- Use **character substitution at each position** to generate neighbors dynamically.
    
- Use `unordered_set` for fast lookups and to track unvisited words.
    

---

🔸 **Why DFS/Backtracking won’t work:**

- You’ll end up exploring all possible paths → exponential time.
    
- Only BFS guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs.
    

---

🔸 **Final Insight:**

This problem is a disguised **graph shortest path** problem where nodes are words and edges exist if they differ by one letter.  
Use BFS from `beginWord` to reach `endWord` with level counting to track distance.

## Imagine a Word Ladder

You're standing on the word `"hit"` and you want to reach the word `"cog"`.

But here’s the **catch**:  
You can only **change one letter at a time**, and **every intermediate word** must be a valid word from the given list (`wordList`).

---

### Goal:

Transform the `beginWord` to the `endWord` **in the fewest number of steps**, where:

- Each step changes only 1 letter
    
- Each resulting word exists in the `wordList`
    

---

### Rules (Core Constraints):

- Only **1 letter can change** in each move.
    
- All **intermediate words** must exist in the `wordList`.
    
- If you **can’t reach `endWord`**, return `0`.
    

---

### Let’s walk through an example:

```txt
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log", "cog"]
```

Let’s build the transformation chain:

```
"hit" → "hot" → "dot" → "dog" → "cog"
```

✔ Each word differs by 1 letter  
✔ Every word (except "hit") is in the word list  
✔ This path has **5 words** → So answer = `5`

---

### How to change one letter?

- From `"hit"` → change `"h"` to `"h"` (same), `"i"` to `"o"` → `"hot"` ✅
    
- `"hot"` → change `"h"` to `"d"` → `"dot"` ✅
    
- `"dot"` → change `"t"` to `"g"` → `"dog"` ✅
    
- `"dog"` → change `"d"` to `"c"` → `"cog"` ✅
    

All are in the word list.

---

### What if we remove `"cog"` from the list?

```txt
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log"]  ← "cog" is not here
```

Then even though `"cog"` is logically possible, you **must not count it**, because **it’s not in the list**. So answer = `0`.

---

### Why it’s called a “ladder”?

Think of each transformation as a **step on a ladder** going from `beginWord` to `endWord`, like:

```
hit
│
hot
│
dot
│
dog
│
cog
```

---

### Final Objective:

Return the **minimum number of words** in the shortest valid transformation path **including the first and last words**.

---

## Graph-Based BFS Approach

We'll follow the same method we've been using for all our graph problems:

1. **Each word is a node.**
    
2. **An edge exists between two words if they differ by exactly one character.**
    
3. This forms an **unweighted undirected graph**.
    
4. Then, simply apply **BFS from beginWord to endWord**, just like we did in “Number of Provinces”, “Valid Tree”, etc.
    

---

### C++ Code (Graph Construction + BFS)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isOneCharDiff(const string& a, const string& b) {
        int diff = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); ++i) {
            if (a[i] != b[i]) ++diff;
            if (diff > 1) return false;
        }
        return diff == 1;
    }

    int ladderLength(string beginWord, string endWord, vector<string>& wordList) {
        if (find(wordList.begin(), wordList.end(), endWord) == wordList.end())
            return 0;

        wordList.push_back(beginWord);
        unordered_map<string, vector<string>> adj;

        for (int i = 0; i < wordList.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < wordList.size(); ++j) {
                if (isOneCharDiff(wordList[i], wordList[j])) {
                    adj[wordList[i]].push_back(wordList[j]);
                    adj[wordList[j]].push_back(wordList[i]);
                }
            }
        }

        queue<pair<string, int>> q;
        unordered_set<string> visited;
        q.push({beginWord, 1});
        visited.insert(beginWord);

        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [word, steps] = q.front(); q.pop();
            if (word == endWord) return steps;

            for (const string& neighbor : adj[word]) {
                if (!visited.count(neighbor)) {
                    visited.insert(neighbor);
                    q.push({neighbor, steps + 1});
                }
            }
        }

        return 0;
    }
};
```
## Why This Aligns with All Our Past Graph Problems:

- We explicitly **build an adjacency list** based on problem constraints.
    
- We treat each word as a **graph node**.
    
- Edges are formed if a valid transformation is possible.
    
- Then we **BFS to find the shortest path**, just like we did in:
    
    - `Number of Provinces`
        
    - `Graph Valid Tree`
        
    - `Rotten Oranges`
        
    - `01 Matrix` (multi-source BFS)

# METHOD - 2 (BETTER THAN METHOD1)



```cpp
int ladderLength(string beginWord, string endWord, vector<string>& wordList) {
    unordered_set<string> wordSet(wordList.begin(), wordList.end());
    if (!wordSet.count(endWord)) return 0; // if endWord not in list, impossible

    queue<string> q;
    q.push(beginWord);
    int level = 1; // starting from 1 because beginWord counts as a step

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int size = q.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            string word = q.front(); 
            q.pop();

            if (word == endWord) return level;

            for (int pos = 0; pos < word.size(); ++pos) {
                string newWord = word;
                for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; ++c) {
                    if (c == word[pos]) continue; // skip same char
                    newWord[pos] = c;

                    if (wordSet.count(newWord)) {
                        q.push(newWord);
                        wordSet.erase(newWord); // mark visited
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        level++;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## So, which is better?

- The **Method 2** is better than **Method 1**
    
- This **graph-based solution** is **educationally perfect**, aligns with your learning style, and works well.
    

Use this for interviews or when clarity is key.

# OPTIMIZED VERSION 


Let's now **transition from the graph version** (which you understood well) to the **optimized version** that avoids explicitly building the graph — but _still_ uses the **same conceptual foundation**.

We'll take it step by step:

---

## STAGE 1: What was our graph version doing?

We:

1. Treated **each word as a node**.
    
2. Connected two words if they differed by exactly **one character**.
    
3. Then ran a **BFS** from `beginWord` to `endWord`.
    

### But what was the bottleneck?

To build the adjacency list:

- We compared **every word to every other word**.
    
- That’s **O(N² * L)** time complexity (`N = word count`, `L = word length`).
    

---

## STAGE 2: Can we generate neighbors faster?

Yes! Instead of comparing all word pairs, let’s generate a _pattern-based wildcard map_.

### Core Trick: Word Masking with Wildcards

- Turn words into patterns by replacing each character with a `*` one at a time.
    
- For example:
    
    - `"dog"` → `"*og"`, `"d*g"`, `"do*"`
        
    - `"dot"` → `"*ot"`, `"d*t"`, `"do*"`
        
- These help us **group neighbors** efficiently.
    

### Now, instead of comparing every pair:

- For a word, generate all wildcard patterns.
    
- For each pattern, look up all words that share that pattern.
    
- These are your **valid neighbors** — with just **O(L)** processing.
    

---

## STAGE 3: Optimized BFS using Pattern Map

Let’s now look at the optimized code you saw earlier — explained clearly.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int ladderLength(string beginWord, string endWord, vector<string>& wordList) {
        unordered_set<string> wordSet(wordList.begin(), wordList.end());
        if (!wordSet.count(endWord)) return 0;

        unordered_map<string, vector<string>> patternMap;
        int L = beginWord.length();

        // Preprocess: build pattern map
        for (string& word : wordSet) {
            for (int i = 0; i < L; ++i) {
                string pattern = word.substr(0, i) + "*" + word.substr(i + 1);
                patternMap[pattern].push_back(word);
            }
        }

        // BFS
        queue<pair<string, int>> q;
        q.push({beginWord, 1});
        unordered_set<string> visited;
        visited.insert(beginWord);

        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [word, level] = q.front(); q.pop();

            for (int i = 0; i < L; ++i) {
                string pattern = word.substr(0, i) + "*" + word.substr(i + 1);

                for (string& neighbor : patternMap[pattern]) {
                    if (neighbor == endWord) return level + 1;
                    if (!visited.count(neighbor)) {
                        visited.insert(neighbor);
                        q.push({neighbor, level + 1});
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return 0;
    }
};
```

## Summary: What's really happening?

- **You’re still doing BFS.**
    
- But instead of comparing each word manually, you're using **precomputed transformation patterns** to jump to neighbors directly.
    
- That saves time and is elegant.
    

    

Let me know how you’d like to proceed.

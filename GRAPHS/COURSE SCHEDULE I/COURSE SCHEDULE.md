Great! Let’s now dive into **LeetCode 210. Course Schedule II** — the follow-up to cycle detection in directed graphs, and a perfect use case for **Kahn’s Algorithm (BFS Topological Sort)**.

---

### ✅ **LeetCode Style Problem**

> **210. Course Schedule II**
> 
> There are `numCourses` courses labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`.  
> You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a, b]` means you must take course `b` before course `a`.
> 
> Return **any valid order** in which you can finish all courses.  
> If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an **empty array**.

---

### 🧠 **Key Insight**

This is classic **Topological Sort**:

- Each course is a **node**.
    
- Each `[a, b]` is a **directed edge from b → a**.
    

You return the **topo sort** order (only possible if there’s **no cycle**).

---

### ✅ **Approach (Kahn’s Algorithm – BFS Topo Sort)**

1. **Build graph** using adjacency list.
    
2. **Compute indegree** for each node.
    
3. **Push indegree 0 nodes** into a queue.
    
4. **Process BFS**:
    
    - Pop from queue, append to result.
        
    - Decrease indegree of neighbors, and if any neighbor becomes 0, push to queue.
        
5. If the result size is less than `numCourses`, there's a **cycle**, return empty array.
    

---

Absolutely! Here's the **LeetCode-style description** for **Course Schedule I**, which is focused purely on **cycle detection in a directed graph** using either **DFS** or **Kahn’s Algorithm (BFS)**.

---

### ✅ **LeetCode 207. Course Schedule**

> You are given a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`.  
> You are also given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a, b]` indicates that you must take **course `b` before course `a`**.
> 
> Return **true** if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return **false**.

---

### 🔁 Example

**Input:**  
`numCourses = 2`, `prerequisites = [[1, 0]]`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** You can take course 0 first, then course 1.

---

### 🔁 Example 2

**Input:**  
`numCourses = 2`, `prerequisites = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]`  
**Output:** `false`  
**Explanation:** There is a cycle. You can't finish both.

---

### 🧠 What’s Really Being Asked?

Can you finish all courses **without encountering any cycles** in the directed graph formed by the prerequisites?

- This is equivalent to checking:
    
    > Is the graph a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**?
    

---

Would you like to solve this one using **DFS cycle detection (with pathVisited)** first or **BFS Kahn's Algorithm**?  
Let me know your grind style — and I’ll only _nudge_.

---


Perfect instinct! Yes, this is a textbook **Kahn’s Algorithm** application.

Let’s nudge your thoughts forward — without giving code — just steps:

---

### 🔁 What you’re given:

- `numCourses` = total number of courses (nodes).
    
- `prerequisites = [[a, b], ...]` = directed edges (`b → a`).
    

You’re to **detect if there’s a cycle**.

---

### ⚙️ Step-by-step for Kahn's Algorithm (Cycle Detection via BFS Topological Sort):

1. **Build Adjacency List**
    
    - For every `[a, b]` → add `a` in `adj[b]`.
        
2. **Track Indegree of Each Node**
    
    - `indegree[i]` = number of incoming edges to course `i`.
        
3. **Initialize Queue with Zero Indegree Nodes**
    
4. **BFS Loop**
    
    - Pop from queue.
        
    - Add to `visitedCount`.
        
    - For every neighbor, reduce `indegree`. If it becomes `0`, push to queue.
        
5. **Final Check**
    
    - If `visitedCount == numCourses`, return `true` → all courses are doable.
        
    - Else, return `false` → there’s a cycle.

That’s it. Now, give it a try. Let me know when you're ready to check or if you want help debugging your grind.

# MINO-NOTE : 

🔹 **Problem:** Course Schedule I (Leetcode 207)  
🔹 **Graph Type:** Directed Graph (Adjacency List)  
🔹 **Technique:** Cycle Detection using Kahn’s Algorithm (BFS Topological Sort)  
🔹 **Core Template:** Kahn’s Algorithm (In-degree based Topological Sort)  
🔹 **Pattern Tag:** #CycleDetection #TopologicalSort #DirectedGraph #KahnsAlgorithm

---

🔸 **Logic Summary:**

- Courses = Nodes, Prerequisites = Directed Edges
    
- Build a graph from prerequisites → `adj[]`
    
- Compute `in-degree[]` for each node (how many prerequisites)
    
- Push all courses with `in-degree 0` into queue
    
- Do BFS:
    
    - Pop from queue, increment `count`
        
    - Reduce in-degree of its neighbors
        
    - If any neighbor’s in-degree becomes 0 → push into queue
        
- If `count == numCourses`, return `true` (no cycle)
    
- Else, return `false` (cycle exists)
    

---

🔸 **Trick:**

- A course with **non-zero in-degree left** → part of a **cycle**
    
- You **don’t need DFS** if you're using Kahn’s (BFS-based)
    

---

🔸 **Why DFS-recursion method isn’t used here:**

- It works (using recursion stack), but BFS (Kahn's) is cleaner for **detecting if it’s possible to finish all courses**
    
- Also **more intuitive for dependency resolution problems**
    

---

🔸 **Final Insight:**

This problem reduces to:

> Can you finish all courses → Is the graph **acyclic**?

Kahn's Algorithm is preferred in interviews when asked for:

- BFS-based solution
    
- More "iterative" control
    
- Scheduling / ordering problems
    

Also forms the **foundation for Course Schedule II**, where you return the actual **ordering**.

Here’s the **final C++ code** using **Kahn’s Algorithm** (BFS Topological Sort) for the LeetCode Course Schedule problem (ID: **207. Course Schedule**):

---

### ✅ Problem Summary

Return `true` if it's possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites (i.e., the graph is a **DAG** — no cycles).

---

### ✅ Final Code (C++ — Kahn's Algo)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(numCourses);     // Adjacency list
        vector<int> indegree(numCourses, 0);     // Indegree for each course

        // Build the graph
        for (auto& pre : prerequisites) {
            int course = pre[0];
            int prereq = pre[1];
            adj[prereq].push_back(course);
            indegree[course]++;
        }

        // Queue for BFS
        queue<int> q;

        // Add all nodes with indegree 0
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) {
                q.push(i);
            }
        }

        int visitedCount = 0;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            visitedCount++;

            for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
                indegree[neighbor]--;
                if (indegree[neighbor] == 0) {
                    q.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }

        // If we visited all courses, no cycle exists
        return visitedCount == numCourses;
    }
};
```

---

### 🧠 Time & Space Complexity

- **Time:** `O(N + E)` — N courses and E edges (prerequisites).
    
- **Space:** `O(N + E)` — Adjacency list and indegree array.

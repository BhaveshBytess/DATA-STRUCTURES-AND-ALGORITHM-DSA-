# **Problem: Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph**

ğŸ“„ **LeetCode Style Format**

---

**You are given an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in an undirected graph, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, and a 2D array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [uáµ¢, váµ¢]` represents an undirected edge between nodes `uáµ¢` and `váµ¢`.**

Return the **number of connected components** in the graph.

---

### ğŸ”¸ **Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 2
```

### ğŸ”¸ **Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: 1
```

---

### ğŸ”¹ **Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 2000`
* `0 <= edges.length <= 5000`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= uáµ¢, váµ¢ < n`
* `uáµ¢ â‰  váµ¢`
* There are no repeated edges.

### **Mini Note**

ğŸ”¹ **Problem:** Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph
ğŸ”¹ **Graph Type:** Undirected Graph (Adjacency List)
ğŸ”¹ **Technique:** DFS (or BFS) Traversal + Visited Tracking
ğŸ”¹ **Core Template:** Count how many times DFS starts â†’ each time = new component
ğŸ”¹ **Pattern Tag:** #GraphTraversal #ConnectedComponents

---

ğŸ”¸ **Logic Summary:**

* Build the adjacency list from the edge list
* Maintain a `visited[]` array
* For every unvisited node, perform DFS to mark the entire connected component
* Count how many such independent DFS traversals were done â€” thatâ€™s the number of connected components

---

ğŸ”¸ **Trick:**

* Each DFS traversal discovers one full component
* The total number of DFS calls = number of components

---

ğŸ”¸ **Why Union Find can be used here:**

* Union Find is a more optimal approach if the graph is very large
* Especially useful in dynamic graphs (when edges are being added in real time)

---

ğŸ”¸ **Final Insight:**
This is the **foundation problem** for any graph question involving **connected components**. Whether grid-based, string-based, or DSU-based, this logic will come up repeatedly.

# SOLUTION

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(int node, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<bool>& visited) {
        visited[node] = true;
        for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                dfs(neighbor, adj, visited);
            }
        }
    }

    int countComponents(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n); // adjacency list

        // Build graph
        for (auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            adj[u].push_back(v);
            adj[v].push_back(u); // because undirected
        }

        vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        int components = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                components++;        // new component found
                dfs(i, adj, visited);
            }
        }

        return components;
    }
};
```

### Quick Intuition Recap:

- Each unvisited node â†’ start of a new component.
    
- DFS marks all reachable nodes from it.
    
- Every time you enter DFS from the main loop, thatâ€™s a new component.
